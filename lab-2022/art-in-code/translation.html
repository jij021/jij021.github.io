                The South is known for stick-to-your-ribs, home cooking, country and blues music and theme parks like Disneyland or Six Flags. The weather tends to be hot and humid all year round, which makes the region perfect for fishing or going to the beach.

                The North, particularly the Middle Atlantic states and the Great Lakes area of the Midwest, became more and more typified by big cities, big business, and big industrial complexes. Its ample natural resources, excellent inland waterway system, and proliferating railways confirmed the North as the economic hub of the country. The North is also known for its cold winter seasons when it usually snows.
