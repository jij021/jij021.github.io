<!-- This recipe is inspired by something that happened to a friend and I multiple times when we were presented with the question, "What do you want to eat for dinner?". When I have to decide, I usually opt to get take-out or eat out since I am not a very good cook. However, I also find eating with others to be more of a social event. It's less about the food for me and more about what we end up doing together. -->

                <p id="description">A dinner for when going out just isn't optimal. Unlike "Dinner: Plan A," this recipe
                    can be done in 10 minutes at minimum (or never at maximum, depending on who you're eating with, so
                    choose your ingredients wisely).

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Prep work:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Set yourself and the other person in a warm room together to let yourselves mingle and figure out
                    what to get for dinner. <em>See notes for more details.</em></li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Main course:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Order the meal online. Locate the establishment on a phone for later.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare a show or movie to watch. Finely comb through the selection available.</li>
                <li>Once meal is ready, quickly grab car keys to pick the food up. If establishment is within walking
                    distance, skip this step.</li>
                <li>Bring the food back home or grab your food from the delivery person. Wash hands thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Allow the food to cool on the table as the conversation with your friend gets carried away. Skip
                    this step if you're starving.</li>
                <li>Turn TV on and put the volume on high for a more immersive experience.</li>
                <li>For the best experience, garnish your meal by commentating on whatever you're watching with your
                    dining companion.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <p>If figuring out what to eat takes longer than 10 minutes, just get pizza.</p>
