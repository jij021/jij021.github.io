            <p>This question is timeless, yet the topic remains vital for understanding the human condition, as no singular definition of "home" exists.</p>
            <p>This site acts as a visual database of what home may mean for different people.</p>
            <p>By partaking in an 11 question survey, you can generate a visual, abstract representation of what "home" may mean to you based on your answers. You can then see how your result compares to others who may (or may not) think differently from you from the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>.</p>
            <p>However, this is just a small, general survey, and the generated visual component of it only represents a small part of what makes you unique.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the outcome, every answer and result come together to celebrate the diversity of what "home" means.</p>

                <li>Basically, a concept that will be debated forever because it is both 1&#41; essential to the human experience and 2&#41; its definition will differ from person to person (ie, justice, democracy, etc). Better defined <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095758376" target="_blank">here</a> by Oxford.</li>
                <li>From an anthropogenic lens, multiple "meanings" of home exist.
