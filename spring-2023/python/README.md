# Python: Data, Science & Design 2023 Spring Final

I wanted this project to document a recent trip I made with my friends earlier in the semester where they came to visit NYC during their spring break.
It's meant to act as a digital pinup board of memories from this trip.

This project includes the most iconic pictures we took separated in categories for easier viewing:
* Selfies
* Food 
* Places
* Polaroids
The last category is from my friend Yejee, who took polaroids throughout our trip too.

The website is made using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap (with some additional external CSS added in).
