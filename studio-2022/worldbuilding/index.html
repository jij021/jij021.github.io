        <p>Truman Burbank's <a id="secret" href="truman-show.html">life</a> seems to be a safe haven amid the chaotic world of the modern age. Toward the threshold of thirty years, the man apparently enjoys an idyll minus the tragic loss of his father. It appears that anyone would feel jealous toward Truman and his occupation, which implies no more challenge than pushing papers. His place of work is fairly cozy and comfortable and his colleagues in no way cause difficulties to Burbank. He is safe from any rivalry, envy, and late payments. Truman has no reason to feel anxious about car accidents on the way home as the car traffic in <a href="seaside.html">Seahaven</a> is always tolerant of its inhabitants. The same old familiar faces every morning conceal no hidden motives. The most 'convenient' neighbors and bypassers just outside the doorstep provide a high spirit within this cozy neighborhood of an ideal Seahaven, the best place on Earth. Every year the city is evidently voted Planet's top town.</p>

        <p>At home, Burbank is awaited by his wife, who does her best to appease her husband in every way. Despite her job at the local hospital, the paced life in the city leaves no space for disturbing news, which in other places may be shared with one's better half. The wife is ready to have a baby, a little Burbank, who would definitely draw the family together even more and would become a new exciting adventure. Meryl is always nearby Truman to relieve him from his existential doubts and hasteful fixation on the unknown. Truman has a best friend named Marlon; the two have been going together through life since early childhood. Marlon is always ready to cheer up his friend by making an appearance with a few cans of <b>the best beer</b>. Having experience of working beyond Seahaven, Marlon knows how good life is here. Truman's mother is readily available to switch the conversation from the painful recollections of the past to the viewing of the family albums, full of the best moments of Truman's life.</p>

        <p>Truman has no need to face the challenges of the outer world beyond his homy city. The local newspapers and TV broadcasts are always nearby to cheer up the mood with news regarding the prosperity in Seahaven and to preserve from the risks of the world beyond this safe place. Truman Burbank is free to leave his home anytime but does not do this in view of the fact that there is <a href="dangers-of-traveling.html">no man who would want to leave the best place on Earth behind</a>. Even the local car bridge is kind enough to recommend against crossing the water. Every sensible person would confirm that there is no need to beat your head against the wall of obstacles and elusive dreams when you have the luxury of a comfortable, safe life and so many reasons to keep it.</p>
