            <h3>A fogged mirror</h3>

            <p>Behind the fog we hear the sounds of a bathroom. After a long moment, a hand wipes the condensation from the glass to reveal the face of TRUMAN BURBANK. He wears a sleeveless Hanes undershirt and blue-stripe pajama bottoms, behind him a white glazed tiled bathroom wall. It is immediately apparent that we are viewing him through a two-way mirror.</p>

            <p>Truman, expressionless, studies his reflection in the mirror. For a long moment, he does nothing. He continues to look impassively into the mirror for what becomes an uncomfortably long time. Still nothing. Finally he speaks, talking to himself in the mirror as if participating in a TV interview.</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Truman</h3>

                <p>...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...risks?...</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-action">Smug, TV smiles</h3>

                <p>...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Meryl (O.S.)</h3>

                <p>Truman, you're gonna be late!</p>
            </div>

            <p>Truman resignedly opens the door of the cabinet and replaces his shaving tackle. It partially obscures the lens of the hidden camera. He closes the door and exits.</p>

            <h3>Int. Kitchen. Morning.</h3>

            <p>MERYL, wearing a stylish robe, sits at the kitchen table sipping coffee. On the table in front of her lies a parcel. TRUMAN enters and glances at the gift.</p>

            <div class="secret-dialogue">
                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Truman</h3>

                <p>What's that?</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Meryl</h3>

                <p>It's a surprise.</p>
            </div>

            <p>TRUMAN unwraps the parcel - an expensive-looking set of exercise sweats.</p>

            <div class="secret-dialogue">
                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Meryl (CONT'D)</h3>
                <h3 class="secret-header-action">(eager for his response)</h3>

                <p>Well, what do you think?</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Truman</h3>

                <p>They're...</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-action">(the merest hesitation)</h3>

                <p>perfect. Thank you.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Truman returns Meryl's kiss.</p>

            <div class="secret-dialogue">
                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Meryl</h3>
                <h3 class="secret-header-action">(handing him the sweat top)</h3>

                <p>Try it on.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Truman pulls the top over his head. As he does so, a closer shot focuses on the manufacturer's name.</p>

            <div class="secret-dialogue">
                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Meryl (CONT'D)</h3>

                <p>I thought you could wear them when you do your exercises.</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-action">(afterthought)</h3>

                <p>Pre-shrunk. And they breathe.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>EXT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE. DAY.</h3>

            <p>Wearing a business suit, briefcase in hand, TRUMAN emerges from his pleasant, Victorian-inspired, picket-fenced house into an idyllic suburban street of similarly picturesque homes. A neighbor, SPENCER, is taking in trashcans, whistling a tune. Spencer breaks off abruptly as Truman approaches his car. His license plate reads, "Seahaven - A A Nice Place To Live".</p>

            <div class="secret-dialogue">
                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Spencer</h3>

                <p>Morning, Truman.</p>

                <h3 class="secret-header-action">Truman</h3>

                <p>Morning, Spencer. And in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening and good night.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Spencer's dog, PLUTO, bounds happily over to Truman.</p>

            <div class="secret-dialogue">
                <h3 class="secret-header-name">Truman (CONT'D)</h3>
                <h3 class="secret-header-action">(petting the dog)</h3>

                <p>Hey, Pluto.</p>
