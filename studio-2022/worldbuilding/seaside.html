        <p>A toddler holding a parent's hand and hesitantly taking its first baby steps into Gulf waters. A barefooted couple walking hand in hand along the shoreline, stopping occasionally to examine a seashell. The sun shining atop an azure sky and swelling tide.</p>

        <p>For vacationing couples and families, these are but a few of the picture-perfect moments Seahaven offers almost daily. And that's just along the beach.</p>

        <p>"It is charming and romantic, beautiful and graceful, diverse and eclectic, authentic and unpretentious, alive and vibrant. Perhaps the dream for Seahaven 30 years ago was the dream for life itself."</p>
