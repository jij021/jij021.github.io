                <h2>"You are now leaving Seahaven! Are you sure it's a good idea?"</h2>

                <p>If you're planning to travel, be aware you may be putting your personal health and wellbeing at risk, especially if you're seeking to go to unfamiliar, distant, or remote areas. Even with the appropriate precautions, new environmental conditions can leave dramatic and abrupt detrimental effects on you.</p>

                <p>Some of the environmental risks you may encounter while traveling include:</p>

                <ul class="traveling-content-list">
                    <li>altitude</li>
                    <li>heat and humidity</li>
                    <li>ultraviolet radiation from the sun</li>
                    <li>foodborne and waterborne health risks</li>
                    <li>travelers' diarrhea</li>
                    <li>animals and insects</li>
                    <li>intestinal parasites</li>
                </ul>

                <p>... and that's not even covering the dangers of water, especially the ocean. If you're considering traveling by ship or boat, you should definitely reconsider your options, as hundreds of maritime disasters occur every year. That's right, even with technology as advanced as today, it's impossible to predict everything that may happen, whether it be related to storms or simply due to an unfortunate wave that's too big for the ship to handle out at sea.</p>

                <div class="traveling-content-diseases">
                    <p>Not to mention, you may also be exposed to a number of infectious diseases while on a trip. Though some diseases may be prevented by vaccination, there are some infectious diseases, including some of the most important and most dangerous, that have no vaccine or cure with current modern medicine.</p>

                    <p>Some modes of transmission for infectious diseases include:</p>

                    <ul class="traveling-content-list">
                        <li>foodborne and waterborne diseases</li>
                        <li>vector-borne diseases</li>
                        <li>zoonoses (diseases transmitted by animals)</li>
                        <li>sexually transmitted diseases</li>
                        <li>bloodborne diseases</li>
                        <li>airborne diseases</li>
                        <li>diseases transmitted via soil</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Before you travel, consider your options and think about whether the trip is worth these many risks. Sometimes, it's a better idea to just <a class="link-place" href="index.html">stay home</a> and enjoy the many good things you already have than try to explore elsewhere.</p>
