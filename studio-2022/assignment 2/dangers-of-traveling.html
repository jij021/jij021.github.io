        <h1>Health risks when travelling</h1>

        <p>Travelling can increase risks to personal health and wellbeing, and these risks should be understood when planning travel, particularly to unfamiliar, distant or remote areas. Taking appropriate precautions before beginning a trip can reduce these risks and ensure a plan is in place in the event that you are injured or suffer from another health condition when away from <a href="index.html">home</a>.</p>

        <p>Travellers often experience abrupt and dramatic changes in environmental conditions, which may have detrimental effects on health and well-being. Travel may involve major changes in altitude, temperature and humidity, and exposure to microbes, animals and insects. The negative impact of sudden changes in the environment can be minimized by taking simple precautions.</p>

        <h2>Am I at risk for infectious diseases while traveling?</h2>

        <p>Depending on the travel destination, travellers may be exposed to a number of infectious diseases; exposure depends on the presence of infectious agents in the area to be visited. The risk of becoming infected will vary according to the purpose of the trip and the itinerary within the area, the standards of accommodation, hygiene and sanitation, as well as the behaviour of the traveller. In some instances, disease can be prevented by vaccination, but there are some infectious diseases, including some of the most important and most dangerous, for which no vaccines exist.</p>
