        <h1>The best way to experience Seaside is to <a href="./index.html">stay</a> in Seaside.</h1>

        <p>A toddler holding a parent's hand and hesitantly taking its first baby steps into Gulf waters. A barefooted couple walking hand in hand along the shoreline, stopping occasionally to examine a seashell. The sun shining atop an azure sky and swelling tide.</p>

        <p>For vacationing couples and families, these are but a few of the picture-perfect moments Seaside offers almost daily. And that's just along the beach.</p>
            
        <p>Wherever you find yourself in Seaside, wherever you turn, you will recognize more and more that it was purposely built to help visitors create lasting memories.</p>
            
        <p>"It is charming and romantic, beautiful and graceful, diverse and eclectic, authentic and unpretentious, alive and vibrant. Perhaps the dream for Seaside 30 years ago was the dream for life itself."</p>

        <p>Beaches have a timeless appeal, and Seaside's sand and surf is no exception. Visitors can expect to witness the picturesque moments so often associated with the ideal beach vacation. Whether it be building sandcastles with the family or taking a moonlight promenade after dinner, vacationers will discover that mornings, days, and nights at Seaside all have their own unique appeal.</p>
